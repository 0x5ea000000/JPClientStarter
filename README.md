# League of Lengend Japanese Client Starter V2

For Garena servers only.

## Disclamer
Do as your own risk!!!

## Changelogs
### V2:
- add quick file copy from Riot LOL (or my language pack) to Garena LOL.

### V1:
- add quick language changer.

## How to use
1. Go to download and get built program (or build it yourself, copy 2 dll files to the same directory of your program) and japanese pack (extract from Riot servers).
2. Extract the pack and put it to game directory.
3. Run LOL from Garena.
4. Run JPClientStart program and choose change language or copy file.
- There are 4 language options:
  - 1: Vietnamese
  - 2: English
  - 3: Japanese
  - 4: Korean
5. Enjoy :D

## Notice
- Garena change token rapidly so you need to run JPClientStart program quickly after run LOL from Garena. If you want to change the language after, you need to do step 3, 4 again.
- Need to re-copy pack after update.
- If you want to play korean, download korean pack (extract from Riot servers) from somewhere and put to game directory and choose 4.
- Tell me if you want more language options (but you need create language pack yourself) or fell free to create pull request. :D
